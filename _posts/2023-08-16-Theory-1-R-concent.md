##What can R do?


Programming Fundamentals: Having a basic understanding of programming concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, and functions will provide a solid foundation for learning R.

Statistical Concepts: Since R is widely used for data analysis and statistics, having a grasp of statistical concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, hypothesis testing, and regression will greatly assist you in understanding and applying R for data analysis.

Data Structures: R employs various data structures such as vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists. Familiarize yourself with these structures and how they store and organize data.

Vectorized Operations: R is designed to perform operations on entire vectors or arrays of data at once, which makes it efficient and powerful. Understanding how vectorized operations work can enhance your code's performance.

Data Manipulation: Learn about packages like dplyr and tidyr that offer efficient tools for data manipulation, such as filtering, arranging, summarizing, and reshaping data.

Data Visualization: R's visualization capabilities are extensive. Prior exposure to concepts like charts, graphs, and their interpretations will help you make the most of R's visualization packages like ggplot2.
