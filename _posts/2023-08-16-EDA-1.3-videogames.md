> Part 3: Overtime trend and Conclusion

- We need to convert the `release_date` to date datatype,
- We group the data by game genres

```R
# Import library
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
  
# Convert release_date to date format
video_games_separate_genres_df$release_date <- as.Date(video_games_separate_genres_df$release_date, 
  format = "%b %d, %Y")

# Separate rows for multiple genres
genre_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  select(gameGenres, release_date, number_of_plays) %>%
  filter(release_date > as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(gameGenres)
```

Next step, we create a summary table by group the `video_games_separate_genres_df` dataframe by month or year (base on our intension)
## 5. Genres trends Over Time
The target is observe how number of play the game has change over time, potentially it reflect changes in gaming trends.

I want to view trend by year, so I create a new column `release_year` by value of `release_date` column

```R
# Group by genres and release_year and calculate total playing
summary_df <- genre_df %>%
  group_by(gameGenres, release_year = format(release_date, "%Y")) %>%
  summarise(
  number_of_game_release = n(),
  total_playing = sum(number_of_plays)
  )

# Convert datatype
summary_df$release_year <- as.yearmon(summary_df$release_year, format = "%Y")
```

I choose top 7 genres, which have most number of games: "Adventure", "Shooter", "RPG", "Platform", "Indie", "Strategy", "Puzzle"

```R
#select genres
selected_genres <- c("Adventure", "Shooter", "RPG", "Platform", "Indie", "Strategy", "Puzzle")
```

### 5.1 Draw chart demonstrate Number Of Game have Released Follow The Years (by game genres)

```R
# Chart 3.1
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = total_playing, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Number Of Plays Follow The Years (by game genres)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of plays") +
  scale_x_yearmon(breaks = seq(from = as.yearmon("2001-01"), to = as.yearmon("2023-01"), by = 2), format = "%Y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))
```

### 5.2 Draw chart demonstrate Number Of Game Release Follow The Years (by game genres)

```R
# Chart 3.3
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = number_of_game_release, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Number Of Game Release Follow The Years (by game genres)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of game") +
  scale_x_yearmon(breaks = seq(from = as.yearmon("2001-01"), to = as.yearmon("2023-01"), by = 2), format = "%Y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))
```

## 6. Release Date Trends (month within a year)
Analyze if there's a relationship between release dates and game ratings or popularity. Are games released in certain months more likely to perform well?

I want to view trend by year, so I create a new column `release_month` by value of `release_date` column

```R
# Group by genres and release_month and calculate total playing
summary_df <- genre_df %>%
  group_by(gameGenres, release_month = format(release_date, "%m")) %>%
  summarise(total_playing = sum(number_of_plays))

# Convert release_month to numeric format
summary_df$release_month <- as.numeric(summary_df$release_month)
```

### 6.1 Draw chart demonstrate Number Of Plays Follow The Months (by game genres)

```R
#draw chart 3.2
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_month, y = total_plays, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Number Of Plays Follow The Months (by game genres)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of plays") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = 1:12, minor_breaks = NULL) +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))
```

### 6.2 Draw chart demonstrate Number Of Game have Released Follow The Months (by game genres)

```R
# Chart 3.4
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_month, y = number_of_game_release, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Number Of Game have Released Follow The Months (by game genres)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of game have released") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = 1:12, minor_breaks = NULL) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))
```
