## Summary data frame by genres
First we need separate games that have multiple genres into rows
```R
#Separate game that have multiple genres into rows
video_games_separate_genres_df <- video_games_df %>%
  separate_rows(gameGenres, sep = ", ") %>%
  mutate(gameGenres = str_replace_all(gameGenres, 
  "[\\[\\]\\']", "")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(gameGenres != "")
```
this how it look like
```
 title                                   gameGenres
   <chr>                                   <chr>     
 1 Elden Ring                              Adventure 
 2 Elden Ring                              RPG       
 3 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Adventure 
 4 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Puzzle    
 5 Hades                                   Adventure 
 6 Hades                                   Brawler   
 7 Hades                                   Indie     
 8 Hades                                   RPG       
 9 Hollow Knight                           Adventure 
10 Hollow Knight                           Indie     
```
Remember that we need a dataframe that summary all game be it's genres before do analyst
### 1.1 What's genres own most games ?
This is simnple, Just creat a `number_of_games` column to count how many game each genres has, then we arrage it  by descending order
```R
#Create summary data frame
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%          #group by gameGenres
  summarise(number_of_games = n())  #Count number of games

#Drawing bar chart by counting game each genres
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games)%>%      #arragne by descending order
  head(7)%>%                        #get first 7 game genres
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gameGenres, -number_of_games), y= number_of_games, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Number of games by game genres",
       x = "Game genres",
       y = "Number of games") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Output:**

### 1.2 What's Genre Is Highest Rate?
 In specific:
- we will only choose game that have more than 100 player, before calculate `average_rating` of game genres.
- I want to list top game genres have most rating, but only with game genres have `number_of_games` greater than 10.
```R
#Create summary data frame
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%
  filter(number_of_player > 100) %>%    #Only choose game have more than 100 player
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%
  summarise(number_of_games = n(), 
            mean_rating = mean(gameRating)
)
#Drawing bar chart rating of each genres
summary_df %>%
  filter(number_of_games > 10) %>%      #Only choose genres that have more than 10 game
  arrange(-mean_rating)%>%
  head(7)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gameGenres, -mean_rating), y= mean_rating, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Avereage game rating by game genres",
       x = "Game genres",
       y = "Avereage game rating") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 1.3 Genre Popularity:

Identify the most popular game genres based on plays. Do certain genres consistently perform better than others?
- We need to use a variable `total_plays` to sum `number_of_plays` across all games for each `gameGenres`


```R
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%
  summarise(total_plays = sum(number_of_plays))

#Drawing total_plays bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-total_plays) %>%
  head(7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gameGenres, -total_plays), y = total_plays, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::label_number_si(unit = "M", scale = 1e-6)(total_plays)),
            vjust = -0.5, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Total number of plays By game genres",
       x = "Game genres",
       y = "Total number of plays (millions)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(unit = "M", scale = 1e-6)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## 2.1 Developer Impact:

Investigate whether games developed by specific companies tend to have higher ratings, more plays, or better engagement.
## 3.1 Platform Preferences:

Determine which platforms are most popular and assess if there's a correlation between platform choice and factors like rating, plays, or wishlist count.
## 4.1 Player Engagement:

Examine the relationship between the number of plays, players, backlogs, and wishlist counts. Are games with high engagement more likely to have a larger player base?

## Rating vs. Engagement:

Examine if there's a correlation between game ratings and player engagement (plays, players, backlogs).
