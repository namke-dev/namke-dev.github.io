# Intro 

Statistical mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data in order to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions. It provides a framework for understanding uncertainty and variability in various real-world situations. Here are some fundamental concepts in statistical mathematics:

## Data Types:

- Quantitative Data: Numeric data that can be measured and quantified, like height, weight, or income.
- Qualitative Data: Categorical data that describes attributes or characteristics, like gender, color, or product type.
## Descriptive Statistics:

- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode are used to summarize the center of a dataset.
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, and standard deviation quantify the spread or variability of data.
## Probability:

- Probability Theory: The study of uncertainty and randomness, including concepts like events, outcomes, and probability distributions.
- Random Variables: Variables that take on different values in a probabilistic manner.
## Probability Distributions:

- Normal Distribution: A bell-shaped curve that describes many natural phenomena due to its symmetrical and well-defined properties.
- Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with a constant probability of success.
- Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
## Sampling and Estimation:

- Sampling: The process of selecting a subset (sample) from a larger population for analysis.
- Sampling Distributions: The distribution of a sample statistic (e.g., mean) obtained from multiple samples of the same size.
## Hypothesis Testing:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): A statement assumed to be true before conducting a test.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.
p-value: The probability of obtaining the observed data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true.
- Significance Level (Î±): The threshold below which the p-value is considered significant.
## Confidence Intervals:

- Confidence Level: The probability that a confidence interval contains the true population parameter.
- Margin of Error: The range within which the true parameter value is likely to fall.
## Regression Analysis:

- Linear Regression: Modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.
- Multiple Regression: Extending linear regression to include multiple independent variables.
## Experimental Design:

- Control Group: The group in an experiment that does not receive the treatment being studied.
- Randomization: Assigning subjects or treatments randomly to minimize bias.
