> Part 3: Overtime trend and Conclusion

Firstly, we need to convert the `release_date` to date datatype,

then we group the data by game genres
```R
# Import library
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
  
# Convert release_date to date format
video_games_separate_genres_df$release_date <- as.Date(video_games_separate_genres_df$release_date, 
  format = "%b %d, %Y")

# Separate rows for multiple genres
genre_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  select(gameGenres, release_date, number_of_plays) %>%
  filter(release_date > as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(gameGenres)
  
```
Next step, we create a summary table by group the `video_games_separate_genres_df` dataframe by month or year (base on our intension)
## Genres trends Over Time:
The target is observe how number of play the game has change over time, potentially it reflect changes in gaming trends.

I want to view trend by year, so I create a new column `release_year` by value of `release_date` column
```R
# Group by genres and release_year and calculate total playing
summary_df <- genre_df %>%
  group_by(gameGenres, release_year = format(release_date, "%Y")) %>%
  summarise(total_playing = sum(number_of_plays))

# Create the line chart
summary_df$release_year <- as.yearmon(summary_df$release_year, format = "%Y")

#select genres
selected_genres <- c("Adventure", "Shooter", "RPG", "Platform", "Indie", "Strategy", "Puzzle")
#draw chart
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = total_playing, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Game Genres Trend Over Time",
       x = "Release year",
       y = "Total Playing per year") +
  scale_x_yearmon(breaks = seq(from = as.yearmon("2001-01"), to = as.yearmon("2023-01"), by = 2), format = "%Y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))
```

## Release Date Trends (which month):
Analyze if there's a relationship between release dates and game ratings or popularity. Are games released in certain months more likely to perform well?
```R
# Group by genres and release_month and calculate total playing
summary_df <- genre_df %>%
  group_by(gameGenres, release_month = format(release_date, "%m")) %>%
  summarise(total_playing = sum(number_of_plays))

# Convert release_month to numeric format
summary_df$release_month <- as.numeric(summary_df$release_month)
#select genres
selected_genres <- c("Adventure", "Shooter", "RPG", "Platform", "Indie", "Strategy", "Puzzle")

#draw chart
summary_df %>% 
  filter(gameGenres %in% selected_genres) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_month, y = total_playing, color = gameGenres)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Game Genres Trend Over Month In A Year",
       x = "Release month",
       y = "Total number of plays follow the month") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = 1:12, minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(selected_genres)))

```
