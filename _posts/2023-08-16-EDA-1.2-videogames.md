> Part 2: Get close to the factors

## 1. Summary data by Genres
First we need separate games that have multiple genres into rows
```R
#Separate game that have multiple genres into rows
video_games_separate_genres_df <- video_games_df %>%
  separate_rows(gameGenres, sep = ", ") %>%
  mutate(gameGenres = str_replace_all(gameGenres, 
  "[\\[\\]\\']", "")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(gameGenres != "")
```
this how it look like
```
 title                                   gameGenres
   <chr>                                   <chr>     
 1 Elden Ring                              Adventure 
 2 Elden Ring                              RPG       
 3 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Adventure 
 4 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Puzzle    
 5 Hades                                   Adventure 
 6 Hades                                   Brawler   
 7 Hades                                   Indie     
 8 Hades                                   RPG       
 9 Hollow Knight                           Adventure 
10 Hollow Knight                           Indie     
```
Remember that we need a dataframe that summary all game be it's genres before do analyst
### 1.1 What's genres own most games ?
This is simnple, Just creat a `number_of_games` column to count how many game each genres has, then we arrage it  by descending order
```R
#Create summary data frame
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%          #group by gameGenres
  summarise(number_of_games = n())  #Count number of games

#Drawing bar chart by counting game each genres
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games)%>%      #arragne by descending order
  head(7)%>%                        #get first 7 game genres
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gameGenres, -number_of_games), y= number_of_games, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col()
```
**Output:**

### 1.2 What's Genre Is Highest Rate?
 In specific:
- we will only choose game that have more than 100 player, before calculate `average_rating` of game genres.
- I want to list top game genres have most rating, but only with game genres have `number_of_games` greater than 10.
```R
#Create summary data frame
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%
  filter(number_of_player > 100) %>%    #Only choose game have more than 100 player
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%
  summarise(number_of_games = n(), 
            mean_rating = mean(gameRating)
)
#Drawing bar chart rating of each genres
summary_df %>%
  filter(number_of_games > 10) %>%      #Only choose genres that have more than 10 game
  arrange(-mean_rating)%>%
  head(7)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gameGenres, -mean_rating), y= mean_rating, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col()
```

**Output:**

### 1.3 Genre Popularity:

Identify the most popular game genres based on plays. Do certain genres consistently perform better than others?
- We need to use a variable `total_plays` to sum `number_of_plays` across all games for each `gameGenres`


```R
summary_df <- video_games_separate_genres_df %>%  
  group_by(gameGenres) %>%
  summarise(total_plays = sum(number_of_plays))

#Drawing total_plays bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-total_plays) %>%
  head(7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gameGenres, -total_plays), y = total_plays, fill = gameGenres)) +
  geom_col()

```

**Output:**

## 2. Developer Impact (summary data by Developer)

Investigate whether games developed by specific companies tend to have higher ratings, more plays, or better engagement.

First, we need separate games that have multiple developer into rows

```R
#Create summary data frame
data <- video_games_df
summary_df <- data %>%
  separate_rows(developers, sep = ", ") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(developer = str_replace_all(developers, "[\\[\\]\\']", "")) %>%
  filter(developer != "") %>%
  group_by(developer) %>%
  summarise(
    number_of_games = n(),
    total_number_of_plays = sum(number_of_plays),
    total_number_of_player = sum(number_of_player)
  )
```

I do the following chart to follow the Developer factor affect:

- Number of games per Developer
- Number of players per Developer
- Number of plays per Developer

### 2.1 Number of games per developer
```R
#Number Of Games By Developer bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(developer, -number_of_games), y= number_of_games, fill = developer)) +
  geom_col()
  ```

  **Output:**
![image tooltip here](/assets/images/EDA1/Rplot_EDA1_2.2.1.png)
### 2.2 Number of players per developer
```R
#Total Number Of Plays By Developer bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(developer, -total_number_of_plays), y= total_number_of_plays, fill = developer)) +
  geom_col()
```
  **Output:**
![image tooltip here](/assets/images/EDA1/Rplot_EDA1_2.2.2.png)
### 2.3 Number of plays per developer
```R
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(developer, -total_number_of_player), y= total_number_of_player, fill = developer)) +
  geom_col()
```

  **Output:**

## 3. Platform Preferences (summary data by Platform)

Determine which platforms are most popular and assess if there's a correlation between platform choice and factors like rating, plays, or wishlist count.

```R
#Create summary data frame
data <- video_games_df
summary_df <- data %>%
  separate_rows(gamePlatform, sep = ", ") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(gamePlatform = str_replace_all(gamePlatform, "[\\[\\]\\']", "")) %>%
  filter(gamePlatform != "") %>%
  group_by(gamePlatform) %>%
  summarise(
            number_of_games = n(),
            total_number_of_plays = sum(number_of_plays),
            total_number_of_player = sum(number_of_player)
  )
```
I do the following chart to follow the platform factor affect:
- Number of games per platform
- Number of players per platform
- Number of plays per platfrom


### 3.1 Number of games per platform
```R
# Number of game by platform bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gamePlatform, -number_of_games), y= number_of_games, fill = gamePlatform)) +
  geom_col()

```

### 3.2 Number of players per platform

```R
# Number of player by platform bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gamePlatform, -total_number_of_player), y= total_number_of_player, fill = gamePlatform)) +
  geom_col()

```
>Output

### 3.3 Number of plays per platform

```R
# Number of plays by platform bar chart
summary_df %>%
  arrange(-number_of_games) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(gamePlatform, -total_number_of_plays), y= total_number_of_plays, fill = gamePlatform)) +
  geom_col()

```

## 4.1 Rating vs. Engagement:

Examine if there's a correlation between game ratings and player engagement (plays, players, backlogs).
> Polynomial Regression Analysis

```R
# Define the weights for each component of the engagement score
weight_playing <- 0.6
weight_backlogs <- 0.2
weight_wishlist <- 0.2

# Filter the input DataFrame to include only relevant data for engagement calculation
filtered_df <- input_df %>%
  filter(playing > 0, plays > 1000, reviews > 100)

# Calculate the engagement score for each entry using the defined weights
filtered_df$engagement_score <- 
  weight_playing * filtered_df$playing +
  weight_backlogs * filtered_df$backlogs +
  weight_wishlist * filtered_df$wishlist 

# Create a linear regression model using engagement score to predict game rating
model <- lm(rating ~ poly(engagement_score, degree = 1), data = filtered_df)

# Generate new data points for engagement score to make predictions
new_data <- data.frame(engagement_score = seq(0, 3000, by = 100))

# Predict game ratings using the regression model
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)

# Create a scatter plot of actual data points and the regression line
filtered_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = engagement_score, y = rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line(data = new_data, aes(y = predictions), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Engagement Score vs. Game Rating",
       x = "Engagement Score",
       y = "Game Rating") +
  theme_minimal()
```
